What is the Gangu Chettri Kanda? The term "kanda" in Nepali slang refers to a scandal or controversy, usually one involving a leaked video or private matter made public. In this case, Gangu Chettri became the central figure in what many are calling the latest viral Telegram leak.

The video, allegedly featuring Gangu Chettri in a compromising or private situation, was initially circulated through Telegram groups. These groups, often known for sharing viral or sensitive content, quickly spread the video across thousands of users within hours. Soon, the clip made its way to other social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter (X), further amplifying the reach.

Telegram's Role in the Spread Telegram has become one of the most popular apps for both group chats and anonymous sharing in South Asia. The platform’s encryption and relative lack of moderation make it a breeding ground for viral content — both good and bad. In the case of Gangu Chettri, several Telegram groups reportedly posted not only the video but also claimed to have the Gangu Chettri Kanda Telegram link, encouraging users to join and view it.

Some even renamed their groups to things like “Gangu Chhetri Kanda 7” to attract attention and increase followers. This highlights the disturbing trend of using controversy and personal exposure as a tool for clout and group growth.
