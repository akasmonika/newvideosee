Many users searched for the Gangu Chettri video link, unaware of the ethical and legal implications of viewing or distributing such content.

Legal and Ethical Implications In Nepal, the Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) and Cybercrime laws make it illegal to share or distribute explicit content without consent. Those caught sharing the video or group links may face legal action, including fines or imprisonment.

Furthermore, Telegram has a policy that allows users to report such content. Although enforcement can be slow, platforms like Telegram are under increasing pressure to moderate harmful or non-consensual content, especially in the context of viral scandals.
